## Are you a cheater or a cheat script maker? Read this: ‚ö†
With the mods that you make apparently for experience or fun, you give a big blow to the game, because your codes and mods (mods that include cheating through _memory hacking_) fall into the hands of people who suffer from **lack and confusion**. If you want to research the game, you will not gain anything by destroying it.<br>
This game is made by a single person who does most of the development work including modeling, sound editing, coding and photoshop.
It is natural that the game has problems, you can also be constructive instead of being destructive.
